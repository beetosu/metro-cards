# Metro Cards
my attempt at filling the MetroHero sized hole in my heart, following that projects impending shutdown in [July of 2023](https://www.patreon.com/posts/end-of-era-78380459).

**This project is currently in very early stages, demos and deployment instructions tbd**

## Current Stage:
Users can select a metro station to generate a card for it. Each card displays the nearest train arrival times for that station. This info will be updated frequently (~every 45 secs)

## Next Steps:
* Commute specific arrival times (ex. all times for X station going to Y station)
* Card for nearest metro station
* PWA
